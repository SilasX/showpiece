Let's make the web boring but eminently usable. Showpiece is a
compilation of [templates](https://json-template.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/Introducing-JSON-Template.html)
to turn JSON web data into perfect semantic markup. The idea is that web
apps will serve only relevant JSON data and then either client side code
or a separate dedicated server will use these templates to render the final
markup.

The generated markup is crowd-curated to be
* responsive
* accessible
* continuously refined
* semantic
* search-engine optimized
