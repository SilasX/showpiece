Let's make the web boring but eminently usable. Showpiece is a
compilation of [templates](https://json-template.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/Introducing-JSON-Template.html)
to turn JSON web data into perfect semantic markup. The idea is that web
apps will serve only relevant JSON data and then either client side code
or a separate dedicated server will use these templates to render the final
markup.

The web today is a tragedy of the commons: everyone competing for
eyeballs with the result looking like clown vomit. And even when sites
are tastefully designed, they differ enough to hurt usability, which is
in large part consistency. When novelty and consistency conflict, we
should choose consistency.

## Quality

The generated markup is crowd-curated to be
* responsive
* accessible
* continuously refined
* semantic
* search-engine optimized
