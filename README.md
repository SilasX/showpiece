Let's give designers a sane baseline on which to base their work.
Showpiece is a compilation of
[templates](https://json-template.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/Introducing-JSON-Template.html)
to turn JSON descriptions of page elements into perfect semantic markup.
The idea is that web apps will serve only relevant JSON data and then
either client side code or a separate dedicated server will use these
templates to render the final markup.

This isn't an effort to make all web pages look the same, but to
standardize expressive markup and allow designers maximum freedom while
giving them a familiar standard. Sites using showpiece can crib from a
common pool of styles, and are expressive enough to gracefully degrade
on all devices and clients.

### Quality

The resulting markup is crowd-curated to be
* responsive
* accessible
* continuously refined
* semantic
* search-engine optimized

### Efficiency

* Language and framework agnostic
* Protect designers from noob developers
* Confidently share stylesheets
